# Code refactor for Horiseon - Marketing Agency

## Description

In this project I refactored an existing code for a marketing agency's website. For this, I improved the codebase to increase its accessibility, by

## Things I did

### In the .html file

- I replaced non-semantic elements with their semantic version in both html and css files. For example, in the navigation bar, I replaced elements like 'div' with 'nav'. I also declared a 'main' section, inside which I replaced some of the 'div' with 'section' selectors.
- I deleted closing tags that were added after self-closing tags in the main section.

- I corrected links that weren't functioning correctly. To do this, I added property names and values to declaration in the header.
- I added header and footer elements.

### In the .css file

- In the css file, I updated the class declarations to fit the changes I made in the html file, by renaming the class attributes.
- To signpost the changes made, I added comments before the declaration blocks.
- To avoid the repetition of declaration blocks for image and heading child classes inside 'benefits' class, I applied the class group property.
