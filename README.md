# Code refactor for Horiseaon - Marketing Agency 

## Description
In this project I refactored an existing code for a marketing agency's website. For this, I improved the codebase to increase its accessibility. 
## What I did 
* I corrected links that weren't functioning correctly
* I improved the semantic structure of the HTML code by replacing non-semantic elements with the semantic version. 
* I renamed class attributes in the css file
